<p>Video games have been a part of most of my life. When I was 8 years old I got a PS2 for Christmas and I loved it so much. I have obtained many different systems throughout my life and have had so much fun with them. Currently I play PC the most but I sometimes use my PS4 and my Switch. I find video games interesting because they provide you a world to escape into and you have control over your character unlike in a movie or tv show. It is very easy to get started in video games. Just pick a platform and look for games you are interested in. Typically consoles are cheaper to get than PC's but there are a lot more games on PC. You save a lot of money if you build the PC yourself. I have actually built 2 PC's and I upgrade the parts whenever I need to. I would say that this is my proudest related acomplishment. Youtube is your best friend and if you have questions about anything regarding building a PC or even just finding games you might like, I recommend looking there first. </p>
